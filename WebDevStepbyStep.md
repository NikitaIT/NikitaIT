# Web Dev Step by Step 

## Coding in html 
1. Beginning, learn [html](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/). Here you will find a large number of examples.
2. The [validation tool](https://validator.w3.org/) will help you find problems in your markup if you are in doubt about its validity.
3. The most convenient tool for learning html and css is [chrome devtools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/). You can easily try whatever you want in it. 
   - And even get a [visual editor for properties](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/new-in-devtools-90/#flexbox). 
   - And also built-in [accessibility checker](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/accessibility/reference/).
4. You should also pay attention to the text content you are writing. If you do it in Russian, then the [online editor-in-chief](https://glvrd.ru/) will help you.
5. The user experience is important. [ARIA practices](https://w3c.github.io/aria-practices/) document will deepen your understanding of html semantics and help you get your markup right. 

You may find it boring to learn all of this on start. In this case, choose free online simulators. Better ask the community what they recommend. In the Russian segment, the best are [HTML Academy](https://htmlacademy.ru/courses). Previously, it was completely free, now it is not.
